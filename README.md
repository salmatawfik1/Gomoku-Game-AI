- A group project completed as part of the AI course, where my teammates and I implemented a Gomoku (Five in a Row) game solver in Python. The goal of
Gomoku is for a player to get five of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a game board before the other player.
- The game has two modes:
    - Human vs. AI: Allows a human player to compete against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to choose its moves.
    - AI vs. AI: Simulates a match between two AI agentsâ€”one using Minimax, the other using Alpha-Beta pruning.
- Implemented Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms along with helper functions in game logic.
- Developed an appealing GUI to enhance players' experience.
