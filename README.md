- A group project completed as part of the AI course, where my teammates and I implemented a Gomoku (Five in a Row) game solver in Python. The goal of
Gomoku is for a player to get five of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a game board before the other player.
- The game has two modes:
    a. Human vs. AI: Implement a version where a human player can play against the AI. The AI will use the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.
    b. AI vs. AI: Implement a version where the AI plays against itself (The Minimax algorithm against the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm).
- Implemented Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms along with helper functions in game logic.
- Developed an appealing GUI to enhance players' experience.
